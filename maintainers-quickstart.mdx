<Note>
  SourceWizard is currently in early development and may have rough edges. We're actively working on improvements and appreciate your feedback as we refine the platform.
</Note>

## Get started

As a library maintainer, SourceWizard helps you create AI integration scripts that make it easier for developers to adopt your library. Follow these steps to get your library integrated.

## Step 1: Log in to the Dashboard

Sign up as a maintainer in [SourceWizard Dashboard](https://sourcewizard.ai/maintainer-sign-up).

## Step 2: Add Your Package

Navigate to the **Packages** tab and add your package to SourceWizard.

### Configure Setup Prompts

You can update the setup prompt from the package page, and add more framework-specific prompts:

<img src="/images/edit-package.png" alt="Edit package settings" />

- **General Setup Prompt**: Instructions that apply to all frameworks
- **Framework-Specific Prompts**: Customized guidance for Next.js, React, FastAPI, etc.

After you press **Save**, the prompt will be updated in production immediately.

<Tip>
  Write clear, step-by-step instructions in your setup prompts. Include common configuration patterns and best practices for your library.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Initial Testing

Before publishing your integration, test it thoroughly:

### Create a Test Project

```bash
bunx create-next-app sample-app
cd sample-app
```

### Test the CLI Installation

```bash
bunx sourcewizard install <your-package-name>
```

### Verify the Integration

1. Replace placeholder environment variables with real ones
2. Test that your library is working correctly
3. Verify all generated code and configuration files
4. Check that the setup instructions are clear and complete

<Warning>
  Make sure to test with different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) and frameworks to ensure broad compatibility.
</Warning>

## Monitor Performance

### Evals Dashboard

On the main dashboard page, you'll be able to see statistics for your package installations:

<img src="/images/stats.png" alt="Package installation statistics" />

- Total installation count
- Success rate

### Agent Runs

Monitor agent execution in the **Agent Runs** tab:

<img src="/images/agent-runs.png" alt="Agent runs dashboard" />

- View detailed logs of each installation attempt
- Identify where the agent encountered issues
- Analyze what should be updated in your prompt or SDK
- Track improvements over time

Click on any run to see:

<img src="/images/agent-chat-log.png" alt="Agent chat log details" />

- Step-by-step execution log
- Debugging information
- Generated code and configuration

<img src="/images/agent-log-prompt.png" alt="Agent log with prompt details" />

## Best Practices

1. **Keep prompts updated**: When you release new versions, update your setup prompts accordingly, especially for breaking changes.
2. **Test thoroughly**: Verify integrations work across different frameworks and environments
3. **Provide examples**: Include code examples and common use cases in your prompts
4. **Monitor feedback**: Use the dashboard to identify and fix common integration issues

## Next Steps

Once your package is configured and tested:

1. Share the installation command with your community
2. Add it to your library's documentation
3. Monitor the dashboard for feedback and improvements
4. Iterate on your setup prompts based on user success rates
