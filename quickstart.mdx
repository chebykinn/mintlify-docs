## Get started

SourceWizard helps you quickly integrate libraries into your codebase using LLM subagent.

    ## Using the CLI

    The fastest way to get started is with our CLI tool. Simply run:

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup <library-name>
    ```

    ### Example

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup clerk
    ```

    This will:
    - Search for the best package for your needs
    - Install the library with the correct package manager
    - Provide AI-guided setup instructions
    - Generate integration code examples

    ### What happens next?

    The CLI will walk you through:
    1. Package selection and installation
    2. Configuration setup
    3. Code generation for common use cases
    4. Best practices and tips

    ## Using the MCP Server

    For deeper integration with coding agents like Claude Code, use the SourceWizard MCP server.

    ### Step 1: Log in to the Dashboard

    Visit the [SourceWizard Dashboard](https://sourcewizard.ai/dashboard) and log in with your account.

    ### Step 2: Copy MCP Configuration

    Once logged in, navigate to the MCP configuration section and copy your personalized MCP server configuration.

    ### Step 3: Add to Your Coding Agent

    Add the copied configuration to your coding agent's MCP settings.
    For Claude Code, this typically goes in your `.claude.json` or MCP configuration file.

    ### What can you do with MCP?

    With the MCP server connected, you can:
    - Search for packages directly in your AI conversations
    - Get installation and setup guidance
    - Receive context-aware code suggestions
    - Discover reusable code in your codebase
    - Get type checking and linting feedback

## Use Cases

SourceWizard helps you throughout your entire development workflow:

### 1. Package Discovery

Search for packages and code snippets using AI-powered analysis. SourceWizard helps you:
- Find the right library for your specific use case
- Compare similar packages and their features
- Discover hidden gems and emerging libraries
- Get recommendations based on your project context

**Example:** "Find a library for handling dates in TypeScript"

### 2. Smart Installation

Install and configure packages with AI-guided setup:
- Automatic detection of your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
- Configuration file generation
- Environment setup guidance
- Integration with your existing codebase

**Example:** "Install and configure Stripe for payment processing"

### 3. Code Reuse

Discover opportunities to reuse existing code from your codebase or external libraries:
- Identify duplicate functionality in your project
- Find existing implementations before writing new code
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Recommend battle-tested external libraries over custom implementations

**Example:** "Should I write custom authentication or use an existing library?"
