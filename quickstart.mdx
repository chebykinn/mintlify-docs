## Get started

SourceWizard helps you quickly integrate libraries into your codebase using LLM subagent.
Choose the method that works best for your workflow:

## Setup Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MCP Integration">
    ## Using the MCP Server

    If you want to pair SourceWizard with your coding agents, you can use our MCP server.

    ### Step 1: Log in to the Dashboard

    Visit the [SourceWizard Dashboard](https://sourcewizard.ai/dashboard) and log in with your account.

    ### Step 2: Copy MCP Configuration

    Once logged in, navigate to the MCP configuration section and copy your personalized MCP server configuration.

    ### Step 3: Add to Your Coding Agent

    Follow the instructions in the dashboard and add the copied configuration to your coding agent's MCP settings.

    ### What can you do with MCP?

    With the MCP server connected, you can:
    - Search for packages directly in your chat tab
    - Run automatic integrations for SDKs and Tools, see [packages](https://sourcewizard.ai/packages)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    ## Using the CLI

    If you prefer CLI we have a command mode as well. Simply run:

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup <library-name>
    ```

    ### Example

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup clerk
    ```

    This will:
    - Detect your repository configuration and package manager
    - Follow the setup prompt and integrate the library
    - Generate an example page or endpoint using the library

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use Cases

SourceWizard helps you throughout your entire development workflow:

### 1. Automatic Integration

Install and configure packages with LLM-based setup:
- Automatic detection of your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, uv, ...)
- Integration with your existing codebase in all the necessary places (middleware, api, pages, providers)
- Configuration files generation
- Environment setup guidance

**Example:** "Install and configure Clerk for authentication, Resend for sending emails"

Essentially it does everything that is needed to onboard on the library.


### 2. Package Discovery

Search for packages and code snippets. SourceWizard helps you:
- Find the right library for your specific use case
- Compare similar packages and their features
- Discover hidden gems and emerging libraries
- Get recommendations based on your project context, language and framework

**Example:** "Find a library for handling dates in TypeScript"

### 3. Code Reuse (Coming Soon)

Discover opportunities to reuse existing code from your codebase or external libraries:
- Identify duplicate functionality in your project
- Find existing implementations before writing new code
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Recommend production-tested external libraries over custom implementations

**Example:** "Should I write custom authentication or use an existing library?"
