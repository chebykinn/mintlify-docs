<Note>
  SourceWizard is currently in early development and may have rough edges. We're actively working on improvements and appreciate your feedback as we refine the platform.
</Note>

## Get started

SourceWizard helps you quickly integrate libraries into your codebase using LLM subagent.
Choose the method that works best for your workflow:

## Demo

Watch SourceWizard in action:

## Setup Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MCP Integration">
    ## Using the MCP Server

    If you want to pair SourceWizard with your coding agents, you can use our MCP server.

    ### Step 1: Log in to the Dashboard

    Visit the [SourceWizard Dashboard](https://sourcewizard.ai/dashboard) and log in with your account.

    ### Step 2: Copy MCP Configuration

    Once logged in, navigate to the MCP configuration section and copy your personalized MCP server configuration.

    ### Step 3: Add to Your Coding Agent

    Follow the instructions in the dashboard and add the copied configuration to your coding agent's MCP settings.

    ### What can you do with MCP?

    With the MCP server connected, you can:
    - Search for packages directly in your chat tab
    - Run automatic integrations for SDKs and Tools, see [packages](https://sourcewizard.ai/packages)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    ## Using the CLI

    If you prefer CLI we have a command mode as well. Simply run:

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup <library-name>
    ```

    ### Example

    ```bash
    npx ai-setup clerk
    ```

    This will:
    - Detect your repository configuration and package manager
    - Follow the setup prompt and integrate the library
    - Generate an example page or endpoint using the library

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use Cases

SourceWizard helps you throughout your entire development workflow:

### 1. Automatic Integration

Install and configure packages with LLM-based setup:
- Automatic detection of your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, uv, ...)
- Integration with your existing codebase in all the necessary places (middleware, api, pages, providers)
- Configuration files generation
- Environment setup guidance

**Example:** "Install and configure Clerk for authentication, Resend for sending emails"

Essentially it does everything that is needed to onboard on the library.


### 2. Package Discovery

Search for packages and code snippets. SourceWizard helps you:
- Find the right library for your specific use case
- Compare similar packages and their features
- Discover hidden gems and emerging libraries
- Get recommendations based on your project context, language and framework

**Example:** "Find a library for handling dates in TypeScript"

### 3. Code Reuse (Coming Soon)

Discover opportunities to reuse existing code from your codebase or external libraries:
- Identify duplicate functionality in your project
- Find existing implementations before writing new code
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Recommend production-tested external libraries over custom implementations

**Example:** "Should I write custom authentication or use an existing library?"

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you store our code?">
    No, we do not store your code. Files are processed locally as much as possible and only the minimum necessary information is sent to the LLM for processing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you read secrets from our codebase?">
    Definitely not, we do not read secrets from your codebase. Env files are processed locally as well, and hidden from LLM: [https://github.com/sourcewizard-ai/sourcewizard/blob/main/install-agent/new-agent.ts#L500](Here's how). We welcome any contributions to filter more data, the current check is very basic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the current status of SourceWizard?">
    SourceWizard is currently in alpha. We're actively developing and improving the product based on user feedback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does SourceWizard actually do?">
    SourceWizard runs a coding agent that understands your repository structure and executes custom integration instructions. It analyzes your project configuration, detects your tech stack, and runs the necessary steps to integrate supported libraries into your codebase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is SourceWizard open source?">
    The client that runs on your repository is open source and will always be. This ensures transparency and allows you to verify exactly what's happening with your code. The server part is not open source though.
